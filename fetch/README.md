This is my submission for Fetch's iOS Engineer Apprentinceship roles. 

Please clone this repository and open the project folder in xCode.
Press run to be taken to the list of Desserts. Touch on a dessert item to be taken to the DetailView that contains the name, instructions, and ingredients/measurements. 

It was completed using SwiftUI, xCode 13.3, and written in Swift.

I was able to achieve the desired functionality of the application, but struggled to refactor parts of my code that had redundancy. I have 2 fetchData functions in my NetworkManager class that could definitely use refactoring, but I had a hard time making the code more modular based on the different inputs. 

The main issue that prevented me from saving more lines of code came from determining the data type returned from the JSON decoder at run time. 

I'd like to thank the hiring team at Fetch for giving me the opportunity to showcase my native iOS developing skills! It was a fun exercise.
